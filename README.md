## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind-CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS FrameWork


### What I learned

In creating a News homepage with React, Tailwind CSS, and mobile responsiveness using grid and flex, I learned how to effectively structure the layout of a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements. By using grid and flex, I gained insights into building responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

I also implemented a menu toggle feature for small devices, allowing users to open and close the menu when viewing the page on mobile devices. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a clean and accessible way to navigate the site.

Throughout the project, I further developed my skills in React by utilizing components such as 
```html
<AsideNews/>
```
to render dynamic news content. By leveraging Tailwind CSS, I efficiently styled the components and applied responsive classes to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design across various devices.

Overall, this project helped me improve my understanding of structuring layouts with semantic HTML elements, creating responsive designs with grid and flex, implementing menu toggle functionality, and enhancing user experience in a news website context.
